* Overview
This package adds support for the formats in the [[https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1687/3931/][IEEE 1687]] spec. It provides a new major mode ~icl-mode~ that includes basic syntax highlighting, indentation, and imenu support for the Instrument Connectivity Language (ICL). Also sets up ~.pdl~ files to better support the Procedural Description Language (PDL) extensions.
** PDL keywords
To add a subset of the PDL keywords to ~tcl-mode~ call the ~icl-add-pdl-keywords~ function:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'tcl
    (icl-add-pdl-keywords))
#+end_src
